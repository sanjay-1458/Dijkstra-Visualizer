# 🚀 Dijkstra Visualizer

## 📌 Overview
Dijkstra Visualizer is a web application that helps understand how **Dijkstra's algorithm** finds the shortest path in an `n × m` grid filled with walls.  
Users can set a **source**, **destination**, and **obstacles (walls)** and then visualize the algorithm finding the shortest path.

## 🌟 Features
✅ **Interactive Grid** – Click to set source, destination, and walls  
✅ **Algorithm Visualization** – Watch how Dijkstra’s algorithm explores nodes  
✅ **Real-time Animation** – Smooth visualization of the shortest path  
✅ **Customizable Grid** – Change grid size and obstacles dynamically

## 🖥️ Initial Position  
This is how the grid looks before the algorithm starts:

## 🏁 Final Shortest Path  
After running Dijkstra’s algorithm, the shortest path is highlighted:
